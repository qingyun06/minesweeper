Upon first opening the application, you will be greeted by the welcome screen. Click "Start New Game" to start a new game, or "Continue", if you would like to continue the previous round (if applicable). 

Once the welcome screen has disappeared, LEFT CLICK on any one of the tiles to start the game.

A portion of tiles will become “cleared”, and the timer in the upper left corner will begin counting upwards from zero. 

The numbers on uncovered tiles indicate how many “mines” are adjacent to that tile. A tile is adjacent to another tile when it shares at least one corner with the other tile. If an uncovered tile does not have a number on it, there are no mines adjacent to that tile. 

Once you are certain that you have discovered a mine, RIGHT CLICK the tile to place a flag on it. You can only place as many flags as there are in your inventory, which can be seen in the upper left corner beside the timer. Right click a flagged tile to remove its flag. 

LEFT CLICK a tile to clear it. If you clear a tile that is covering a mine, the game is over. 

The goal of the game is to clear all tiles that do not have mines under them as fast as possible. 

If you clear all tiles successfully, you will receive a notification indicating the total time elapsed, which will be recorded in a text file that can be accessed by a) clicking on the settings icon --> Score Record, or b) manually opening "record.txt" in the application folder. 

You can also save the current game and come back later by clicking on the settings icon --> Save and Quit.
